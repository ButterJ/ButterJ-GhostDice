This mod adds Ghost Dice as a new weapon to the game.
Ghost Dice randomly give +1-2 luck for every 20/18/16/12 enemies killed with it during a wave.

The ghost dice are designed to fit well into the already established ethereal weapons. It adds an alternative ranged ethereal weapon, having faster attack speed but less damage than the ghost scepter.
Differently than the Ghost Scepter, the Ghost Dice are able to kill 20 enemies in the first wave. After killing 20/18/16/12 enemies with the Ghost Dice, they randomly give +1-2 luck.

The randomness of the stat gain was decided for to add to the theme of the Ghost Dice and to balance it with the other ethereal weapons. While other ethereal weapons only give +1 of their respective stat, luck can be obtained easier than health, damage, or attack speed, so the ability to gain more than one luck allows the Ghost Dice to give more luck.

Overall, the Ghost Dice start out with worse stats than other ranged weapons like the Pistol. However, as the Ghost Dice give more luck, players will naturally get more stats from leveling, better items from crates and in the shop, and more fruits.
